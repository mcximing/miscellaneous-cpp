This directory contains miscellaneous cpp files once used in my projects or for practice. They might be more or less useful for future work, but are not complete enough to form a project or repository alone. So I put them here for a backup and possible sharing, with the MIT License.

Note: Though these codes are wrote by me, there might be some code snippets similar to other people's. For possible copyright issues, please contact me.

And why do I not use https://gist.github.com? Because this site can not be visited stably in mainland China for some reason.
